CmpE-283_Availability-Manager
=============================
Build an availability manager that monitors the liveliness of the virtual machines (VM) running on any one of the hosts and restarts any virtual machines that fail on alternate, healthy hosts, using an earlier cached version of the VM.

The theme of Availability Manager in Virtual Machines are:

      1. Monitor the health of Virtual Machines. 
      2. Continuously ping the VMs to check for its availability.
      3. Determine failures.
      4. If there is any failure, identify the cause.
      5. Provide a workaround to recover from the failure.
